1. Purpose of the project
    The purpose of this project is to create my first milestone project to demonstrate to employers that I can skillfully use HTML and CSS to create a static front end project.

    My website is inspired by the Code Institute website and other educational websites. I want it to be a site where people like me who are pivoting into the tech industry can start their journey by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There will be hypothetical classes that will be included on the website that I am offering classes for. I am aiming to document my journey and to provide a visual guide of learning the languages necessary to become a Full Stack Software Developer.
2. User stories

   When the user interacts with my website, I want it to elicit a positive emotional reaction. To ensure that this happens, when considering the user experience I will:

   *Make sure that my website works
   *Enusre that my website is intuitive, simple and enjoyable to use
   *Ensure that the the user experience is considered and implemented from the beginning of the website's life cycle.
   e.g I am starting with a responsive mobile first design that can then be scaled up to tablet and desktop screens. I am also making sure that my images have alternative text so that it can be accessible through screen readers.

   To guide this process, I am using Garett's theory of the 5 planes of UX design.

   Strategy: What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?

   Scope: Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?
   What's on the table for a production release and what's not, at least for now?

   Structure: How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?

   Skeleton: How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?

   Surface: What will the finished product look like?


   External user's goals:
   New users
   Returning users
   Frequent users

   Site owner's goals:


3. Features

4. Future features
Subscription feature where users can subscribe to future newsletters I write about my journey or about general relevant information about technology.

5. Typography and color scheme
6. Wireframes
I am using Balsamiq to create wireframes
